# Extracting the first row
first_row <- A[1, ]
print(first_row)

# Extracting the second column
second_column <- A[, 2]
print(second_column)

R
# Extracting the first row
first_row <- A[1, ]
print(first_row)


[1] 1 3 5



[1] 1 3 5


And if you want to extract the second column, it can be done as follows:

R
# Extracting the second column
second_column <- A[, 2]
print(second_column)


The output will be:


[1] 3 4
