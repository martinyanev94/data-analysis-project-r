# Final Project: Applying R Skills

## Project Overview

This final project aims to assess students' understanding and application of the R programming language as covered in the course. By engaging in practical coding assignments, students will demonstrate their ability to analyze data, create visualizations, and implement statistical models.

## Objectives

- To apply learned R programming concepts in a practical setting.
- To analyze a dataset and derive meaningful insights through statistical techniques and data visualization.
- To create an interactive component using R Shiny to enhance user engagement with the data.

## Project Requirements

### Dataset

Students can choose from the following datasets:

1. **US Cereal Data** - Nutritional information of breakfast cereals.
2. **Diamond Price Data** - Data on diamond pricing based on various attributes.
3. **Old Faithful Geyser Data** - Waiting times between eruptions and durations.

### Tasks

1. **Data Cleaning and Preparation**
   - Load the dataset using appropriate R functions.
   - Explore the data for missing values, outliers, and data types.
   - Clean the dataset by handling missing values and converting data types where necessary.

2. **Data Analysis**
   - Perform at least three descriptive statistical analyses on the dataset. This may include calculating means, medians, variances, or creating frequency tables.
   - Formulate hypotheses for the data and conduct tests for significance using t-tests or ANOVA as applicable.

3. **Data Visualization**
   - Create at least three visualizations that effectively represent findings from your analyses. Consider using:
     - Scatter plots
     - Boxplots
     - Histograms
     - ggplot2 for enhanced visual representation
   - Ensure that all visualizations have appropriate titles, axis labels, and legends.

4. **Interactive Visualization with Shiny**
   - Use the Shiny framework to create a simple web application that allows users to interactively explore the dataset. Features may include:
     - Filter options for different attributes
     - Dynamic plots that update based on user input

5. **Report**
   - Compile your findings, visualizations, and code in a comprehensive report written in R Markdown.
   - The report should include:
     - Introduction to the dataset
     - Overview of analyses conducted and their results
     - Screenshots or links to your Shiny application
     - Conclusion summarizing key insights derived from the data

### Submission Guidelines

- Submit your R Markdown file and ensure that it is properly documented.
- Include the necessary R scripts used in your analysis.
- Links to the Shiny application must be functional and accessible.

### Evaluation Criteria

- Completeness of analyses and tasks.
- Quality and clarity of visualizations.
- Functionality and user experience of the Shiny application.
- Overall presentation of the report, including organization, clarity, and documentation of code.

## Additional Resources

- R documentation and help files.
- Online tutorials for Shiny applications.
- ggplot2 documentation for advanced plotting techniques.
